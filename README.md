# Yoshi 2.0 – Pain of Discipline

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I'm not here to gaze, I'm here to chase my dream
I already know who I'm meant to be
Journey from birth to death, I'm still in between
I can rest in peace later, now I do my best indeed
I wanna see how far I can get
Each day, I won't miss a step
When I just wanna stay in bed
I close my eyes and ask myself
Do you want the pain of discipline or the pain of regret
The pain of progress or the pain of regress
When no one's watching, gotta earn my respect
All along, it's just me vs. myself
Opportunity is there, but all you do is stare
Say you don't care, but the truth is you don't dare
I know you're still unprepared
But we all gotta start somewhere
Everyone's afraid, everyone's scared
Now raise your fist in the air
Failure is temporary, but regret is forever
Waiting's over, it's now or never
Do you want the pain of discipline or the pain of regret
The pain of progress or the pain of regress
When no one's watching, gotta earn my respect
All along, it's just me vs. myself
You never feel ready, you just gotta do it now
No more self-pity, you just gotta do it now
Only got one life, you just gotta do it now
One last time, I'm gonna say it loud
Do you want the pain of discipline or the pain of regret
The pain of progress or the pain of regress
When no one's watching, gotta earn my respect
All along, it's just me vs. myself
